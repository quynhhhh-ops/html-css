    <p>The đàn tính, or tính tẩu (gourd lute), is a stringed musical instrument from tianqin (Chinese: 天琴; pinyin: Tiān qín of Zhuang people in China, imported to Vietnam by the Tày people of Lạng Sơn Province in Vietnam. Although "tính tẩu" originated as a Tày word, both names are used in Vietnamese. The instrument has from two to four strings in from two to four courses. The strings are made of silk, nylon or fishing wire. It is used by shamans in séances in the hope that it will be animated by spirits.</p>
